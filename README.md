I S 300: Introduction to Information Systems
Course Description and Objectives: 
Modern information technologies   have dramatically transformed the economic and   social structures of our society.   Understanding the role of information technology   (IT)   is   critical for firms to   provide competitive advantage   in today’s competitive environment. These days   over 50% of capital expenditures made   by firms are   IT-related.   Knowing   how to effectively   manage   IT   is a   prerequisite for successful   business managers, CIOs, and   CEOs.   This   course   is   designed to   be an   important step towards   building your   IT knowledge   base on the   road to   becoming   a   successful manager. 
The course consists of both   lectures and lab   sessions.   The   lectures will   teach   you   the   language, key concepts, and frameworks for the management of Information   Systems   (IS).   You   are expected to gain an   understanding of the strategic value of IT/IS   as well   as   their   applications   in   today’s   business environment. You will also   be able to develop   basic   IT   project management skills such as system analysis and design,   project   planning,   implementation,   and testing.   The   lab sessions emphasize using computers to analyze,   coordinate,   and solve   organizational decision-making   problems   by   providing a   hands-on environment to learn various business   computer applications such as   Microsoft   Excel,   R, and   MySQL. At the end of this   course,   I   expect   my students to be comfortable taking an active   role   in   today’s   dynamic   IT   business   environment and understand the role of   management   in   IT   solutions.
Course Materials:

Grading: 
Your final grade   is comprised of seven components: a   midterm exam,   a   final   exam,   a   team project, your class participation, quizzes, and the computer   lab.   More   detailed   requirements   and specifications about them will be   provided   in class. The composition   of your final weighted   grade   is: 
1.   Exam   1 .................................................................................................................                      20%
2.   Exam   2 .................................................................................................................                      20%
3.   Team   Project (Business   Plan   Based on an   Emerging   Information Technology)                                            20%
4.   Participation   ..........................................................................................................                      10%
5.   Quizzes (Pre-chapter 6%, in-class 4%)   .................................................................                           10%
6. Computer Lab .......................................................................................................                    20%
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Total: 100%
Please   ignore any Canvas calculations as they might   reflect   the wrong weight   /   grades.
Curve: There will   be   no individual exam or assignment   curves.   If   a   curve   is   needed   on   the final   weighted course grades,   it will   be applied.   If the class average   is   low, I typically curve up.   If the class average is too high,   I   might   curve down   to   satisfy   the   requirements   of the   Dean’s   Office,   but   I   have never needed to curve down the   grades   before   in   my   career. 
Grading Appeals / Regrading: 
Any grade appeals should   be summarized   in an email and   sent   to   your   grader/TA   or   me.   A written appeal   is mandatory to request a   regrade.   If you’re emailing   me,   clearly   indicate your class/section,   name (if different than Canvas), which assignment should   be   regraded, and why.   Do   not   use any other method (such as   Canvas comments) for   such   communication.   Appeals must be filed within seven days after the graded   item   has   been   returned to   you.   In   case   of a   grade appeal,   I regrade the entire assignment,   not just the objected (appealed)   part. 
Exceptions to this   policy may apply in the case   of the final   exams /   projects   due to   deadlines for   UW grade submissions.
Extenuating Circumstances (missed assignments and exams): 
Unexpected events happen   in   life.   If you miss an exam   or assignment   for   a   documentable extenuating circumstance,   I typically count the average of the same grade   category for the missed exam or assignment.   For example,   if a student misses the   midterm   exam for   an   extreme   emergency,   he or she can   have the final exam grade count   for the   missed   exam.   This arrangement will only   be given to students who are able to   produce an   official   document within   a   reasonable time (within 7   days.)   Examples of official extenuating   circumstances   are   medical issues, traffic accidents, participation   in university activities at   the   request   of   university   authorities, death of a first-degree family member, and other   compelling verifiable circumstances beyond the control of the student.   Please note that work,   interviews,   training,   vacations, friend weddings, or medical issues of second-degree relatives   are   not   considered   extenuating circumstances. 
Official documents should   be written in   English and   must cover the exam   date. All   non-United States documents must be authenticated and verified.   I   evaluate these   instances   on   a   case-by-   case   basis. Requesting this policy is inherently a risky move and I don’t recommend it unless there is a documented case. 
Exams (individual): 
There will   be two exams.   Exams will   be   in-class,   in-person, on computer, and   in a   mixed (multiple-choice and essay) test format unless announced otherwise   before the   exam.   Book   chapters to be tested   in exams are   not cumulative. 
Team Project (group): 
Throughout this course, you and your team will develop a business plan based on an emerging information technology of your choice. There will be   small   deliverables   every   other   week to ensure progress. You will present these   business   plans towards   the   end   of the   course. 
This team   project   is specifically designed as   open-ended to enhance your creativity   and teamworking skills.   I expect you to combine the theoretical material   you   learned   in   this   course   with a   practical concept that you   find appealing. 
In this   project,   it   is essential that you choose an “emerging”   information technology   but   not   a   stagnant or declining one.   It is also   important that you   identify   an   “information-related technology” but   not something   like   biotechnology or pure mechanical-technology.   Last   but   not   least, the technology of your choice needs to be suitable   for   business   use.   Some   examples   of   emerging   information technologies are: 
•          Adaptive   Machine   Learning                                      •            Internet-of-Things 
•          Wearable   User   Interfaces                                           •            Edge   Large   Language   Models 
•            Blockchain (NFT, cryptocurrency)                      •            Digital Twin of a   Customer 
•            Disinformation Security                                                  •            Gamification 
•            Spatial   Computing                                                                  •            6G cellular   network 
What is a business plan based on an emerging information technology? 
A   business   plan   is a formal statement of a set of attainable   business goals and   the   plan   to   reach   those goals.   Emerging   information technologies are contemporary advances and   innovations   in      the   information technology (IT) field.   Emerging technologies provide competitive advantage for those who can come up with   innovative   business ideas using   them. A   business   plan   based   on an emerging   information technology combines these two notions to create   a   plan   around   an   IT   product or a   service. 
Business   plans are decision-making tools. There is   no fixed content for   a   business   plan.   Rather,   the goals and audience determine the content and format   of the   business   plan. A   business   plan      represents all aspects of the   business planning   process declaring vision and   strategy   alongside      sub-plans to cover marketing, finance, operations,   human resources as   well   as   a   legal   plan,
when   required. A   business   plan   is a summary of those disciplinary   plans.
Typical structure for a business plan presentation includes: 
•            Mission and vision statements
•          Business description (A   brief   statement   that   explains   what   the   product   or   service   is   and   why   it will   be successful)
•            Business environment analysis
•            SWOT   analysis
•            Industry   background•          Competitor analysis (Understand competitors   and   substitutes.   Explain why   your   idea   is   different.)
•          Market analysis (Identifies   the   market,   the   business's   position   in   it,   and   the   competitors.   It   also assesses the competition and   identifies market trends.   Best   market analyses   are supported with data.)
•            Go-to-market   strategy
•          Operations   plan (May   include supply   chain   and   production   plans)
•            Management   summary
•          Financial plan   (Includes financial   projections, start-up   costs,   funding,   and   investor   pitches.   It   may also include forecasted   income statements, balance sheets,   cash flow   statements,   and   capital expenditure budgets)
•          Timeline   and   milestones
Typically,   business   plans are developed to attract investors. To do   so,   I   strongly   recommend
identifying a competitive product or service.   Give   it a   cool   name.   Make   sure   it   has   potential.   And   finally, figure out the financials: decide on how much   investment   you   need / would   like.
At the end of the course, you will submit peer evaluations   for   your   team   members.   Your   individual grades   may be adjusted   based on these   peer evaluations.
Participation (individual): 
I will   not take attendance every class.   However, you will learn   better   if you are   in   class   daily   to         listen, take   notes and   have your questions answered. Course participation   will   be   a   part   of your   final grade. There might also   be   pop quizzes as a   portion   of the   participation   grade.
For participation, things   I view positively   include:
•          asking insightful   questions   about   assigned   readings
•          redirecting a discussion when the   current   point   has   been   adequately   covered
•          good analysis supported by   case facts   or your   own   experience
•          summarizing or reconciling   previous   comments
•          constructive   disagreement
•          synthesizing   and   advancing   the   discussion
•            a good sense   of   humor
•          drawing generic   learning   points from a   particular case   Factors   I view   negatively   include:
•          lack of involvement – absence,   silence,   detachment   or   disinterest
•          leading   our discussion   into   unrelated   topics
•          spending undue   amount   of time   on   minor   points
•            long,   rambling comments
•          making   undue   noise, or   disturbing   the   lecture
•          disrespectful   attitude   towards   the   instructor   and   classmates
•          being   unprepared,   or   passing   on   a   cold   call
Here are some guidelines for assessing class   participation, especially   when   I   ask   a   question:
Grade 
Criteria 
91-100 
• Gives the right answer or disagrees with my answer. Then, explain and elaborate why. 
• Demonstrates analysis of readings exceptionally well, relating it to other course material. 
• Consistent involvement: keeps focus, responds thoughtfully to others’ comments. 
81-90 
• Gives the right answer, without an explanation of why, sometimes using a single phrase. 
• Shows thorough knowledge of case and readings, has thought through implications. 
• Ongoing involvement: responds to others in a constructive way, thinks through own points. 
71-80 
• Gives the wrong answer but shows some knowledge of case and readings. 
• Builds on others’ contributions. Shows some evidence of trying to interpret or analyze facts. 
• Uneven involvement: demonstrates mediocre evidence of critical thinking. 
61-70 
• Gives the wrong answer and does not demonstrate any knowledge of our readings. 
• Helps move along the discussion in an incremental manner (e.g., repeats some content.) 
• Peripheral involvement: Not much new thought; rephrases, underlines earlier comments. 
51-60 
• Skips answering. Does not demonstrate preparation. 
• Present in class. Not disruptive. 
• States straight facts from the content when called on or directly asked. 
1-50 
• Present, but demonstrates no evidence of preparation. 
• Shows lack of interest or respect for other’s contributions. 
• Obviously did not prepare. 
0 
• Absent. 
•    If present, engages in disruptive behavior. 
• Misses quizzes. 
Peer Evaluations (for your own teammates): 
Any group assignment grade   is   not your individual grade   until   peer evaluations   are   counted   at   the end of the course.   Please   note that this can   be especially controversial   if you   expect the
same grade as your teammates without showing reasonable   effort.
In order to create an incentive for a fair work   environment   in   teams,   I   adjust   group   grades   with
peer evaluations. To do so,   I   need your help to collect   data   on   the   performance   of   each   teammate.   Here   is how   it works:
Each of the   N members of a project team will   be given   100×(N-1)   points to   allocate   among the   other members of the team.   Everyone will distribute those   points among their team   members         EXCLUDING themselves. The individual’s   peer weight   will be the average   of the   allocations
from   his or her team members (usually   100). An   individual’s   project grade will   be   the   team
project’s score weighted by the individual’s   peer weight.   Peer evaluations suggest that   peers   should be   evaluated   on:
•          Prompt and reliable   attendance   at   scheduled   meetings   or working   periods
•          Getting   individual sub-tasks   completed on   time
•          Taking   on   difficult   tasks
•          Contributing   ideas   on   a   regular   basis
•          Contributing specialized   skills   or   knowledge
•            Facilitating effective team   interaction
•          Keeping attitudes   positive   throughout   the   process
For example, let us assume you are   in   a   five-person   group   and   your   teammates   are   John
Smith, Jane   Brown,   Mike   Lee and   Mary   Martinez. This   means you   have 400   points to allocate   among your teammates (because   100x(N-1) is 400, where   N=5)
•          If you   believe everyone contributed   equally, write   “John   Smith:   100,   Jane   Brown:   100,   Mike   Lee:   100,   Mary   Martinez:   100” in the assignment submission section. (This   is   generally   the      most common peer evaluation.)
•          If you   believe Jane contributed significantly   more   than   anyone,   you   can write   “John   Smith:   75, Jane   Brown:   175,   Mike   Lee: 75, Mary   Martinez:   75.”
•          If you   believe Jane did   no contribution   and/or   hindered   your   team   performance,   you   can   write “John Smith:   133, Jane   Brown: 0,   Mike   Lee:   133,   Mary Martinez:   134.”
•          Please   note that all examples   above   add   up   to 400   points.   Last   names   are   required.   Your
sum can   be different based on the team size. After   making   sure you   allocate   points, feel   free   to add any   notes or comments you’d like to share with   me   about   the   group   performance.
Additional comments are optional.
Warning/clarifications: 
•          Include the full (first,   middle   and   last)   name   of your teammates,   as   it’s   shown   on   Canvas.            For example, if your teammates’ name   is John Smith,   don’t   shorten   it   to   Joe,   or   even John,   just write the full name as   John   Smith.
•          If you do not   submit   peer   evaluations,   or   do   not   follow   the   directions   above,   your   grade   in   team assignments may   be deducted.
Quizzes (individual): 
Unless otherwise announced   in class, there will be four quizzes.   Quizzes will   be   in-class,   on   Canvas, and in a multiple-choice test format.   Follow   announcements   carefully.
Computer Lab Sessions (individual): 
Hands-on   practice is an essential   part of this course and   the   information   systems   field   overall. Teaching assistants will conduct lab sessions to improve your skills   in   contemporary
information technologies and tools.   I recommend adding these skills to your   resume.
AoL Quiz Requirement: 
You are required to complete an Assurance of Learning   (AoL)   quiz   for this   course,   which
measures how the   Foster School of Business is   delivering   Assurances   of   Learning.   Assurances   of Learning   help the   Foster School evaluate   how well we are teaching you and they   allow   us   to fine-tune the curriculum to   make sure we are meeting goals   and   objectives   of the course.   Additionally, the overall results   help the   Foster School remain   accredited   through   the 
Association   to   Advance   Collegiate   Schools   of   Business   (AACSB).
The quiz   is administered by the   Undergraduate   Program’s Office through   Canvas. An email announcement will   be sent out   by the last week of the quarter. You should   complete   the   quiz   as   diligently as   possible so that the results are significant   and   impact the   Foster   curriculum.   Thus,         you should approach the quiz as a closed   note,   closed   book test. You   should   not   seek assistance from other students or faculty.   Please do   not discuss the quiz with fellow students.
